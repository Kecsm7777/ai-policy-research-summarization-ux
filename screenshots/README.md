# Screenshots

This folder contains selected visual artifacts illustrating how UX decisions applied to AI system behavior materially affect the reliability and interpretability of generated summaries.

The screenshots focus on output structure, intent constraints, authority boundaries, and confidence signaling rather than visual styling or interface polish.

## Included Artifacts

- **Before vs After Summary Comparison**  
  Demonstrates how an unstructured AI summary can misidentify document identity and scope, and how an intent-constrained summary corrects this behavior.

- **Explicit Non-Claims and Authority Limits**  
  Shows how non-claims are embedded directly into the summary output to prevent downstream misuse or over-interpretation.

- **Confidence and Uncertainty Framing**  
  Illustrates how uncertainty, open questions, and scope limits are surfaced to support calibrated trust rather than false certainty.

## Notes

Screenshots are representative examples intended to demonstrate system behavior and design intent. They are not exhaustive documentation of policy content or analytical methodology.
